				<br>

				<li>Chop the onion into bits, any size really, doesnt matter particularly and throw 
into the frying pan.</li>
				<br>

				<li>Chop the mushrooms and add to the onions</li>
				<br>

				<li>Once the rice is cooked, drain it off and add it into the frying pan</li>
				<br>

				<li>Tip the drained sweetcorn into the pan as well and stir it all up.</li>
