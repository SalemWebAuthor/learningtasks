                <h1>Punish the vote sellers and vote brokers</h1>
                    <p id="p1">Corrupt voters give birth to corrupt politicians. In order to stop corruption, we have to start eliminating it at its birth,
                         that is, during elections.
                        Most of us are aware that vote buying is illegal. But actually, vote selling is also prohibited by the law. 
                        According to Section 261 (a), Article 22 of the Omnibus Election Code, both vote buying and vote selling are prohibited 
                        and punishable. In other words, its not only the candidates, their supporters, or the vote buyers who can be found guilty
                         of an election offense, but the voters or vote sellers can also be punished according to the code.</p>
                <h2>Annual assessment of all public officials by the BIR</h2>
                    <p id="p2">Majority of politicians in the Philippines are rich and generating income from businesses. 
                        Even the poorest mayor in Metro Manila has a net worth of P3.31 million. Therefore, the BIR should not only focus on examining small business
                         owners and professionals, but should also concentrate on investigating the politicians and the companies that are fully or partially owned by
                          them. 
                        The government should not only require public officials to submit their financial statements or statements of assets and liabilities,
                         but they should also assess or audit these public officials annually and make their statements available to the public. This way, the public 
                         will know how they are earning income and increasing their net worth, whether it’s coming from their salary or from their business. 
                        Public officials should be a role model of public trust. They desire to be in a public office. Hence, they should not complain if they
                         will be required to undergo annual tax examination.</p>
                <h1>A more Efficient and Effective Tax System</h1>
                    <p id="p1">To effectively and efficiently collect taxes from taxpayers, especially from politicians, we have to upgrade our tax
                         system, make registrations/tax declarations/payments online, and eliminate unnecessary regulations that only make
                          our system more complicated. The BIR should not only invest in human resources, but also on technology like what 
                          Singapore and other countries that have a more efficient tax system are doing.
                        Creating a better tax system is a job that must be initiated by our congressmen and senators – the lawmakers. 
                        Thus, they have to consult not only with the BIR, Department of Finance and DTI, but also with various independent 
                        tax experts, the business sector, and other taxpayers who are affected by our tax system.</p>
                <h2>Improved Integrity in our justice system</h2>
                    <p id="p2">We have existing good laws in the Philippines. The problem is the low integrity of our justice system.
                         Our laws, themselves, suffer from injustice because they aren’t respected and protected by the authorities that should
                          be protecting them in the first place. Corrupt politicians and government officials are not usually sent to jail.
                        To improve the integrity of our justice system, there should be a collaboration among the DOJ, 
                        Office of the Ombudsman, PNP, NBI, courts, and the civil society to uphold justice in our country. 
                        There should also be a more effective witness protection program to make sure that all witnesses or whistle blowers, 
                        including their families will be safe and protected. Moreover, they should be rewarded and well-compensated to support 
                        their family while they are under a witness protection.</p>
