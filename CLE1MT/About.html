                    <p>We started this website project in order to raise awareness about the effects of Corruption to Society. We are advocates
                        of Anti-Corruption and we started this website to provide meaningful information about Corruption and its constituents. 
                        <p>All information and events provided are factual and intensely researched and inquired by professionals and experts.
                            The goal of providing these types of information accessible to the internet is to let people be aware of bad governance
                            and its effects whether if it is physical, emotional, mental, social, or economical. This allows people to think
                            critically and become law-abiding citizens that understand the importance of good governance and transparency. 
                        </p>
                        <p>We gather information from different articles, journals, interviews, and research papers in order for people all around
                            the web to have easy access of information and facts to promote good governance and to also hopefully let them become
                            Anti-Corrupt Advocates.
